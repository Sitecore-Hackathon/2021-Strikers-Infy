You can find a very good reference to Github flavoured markdown reference in [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). If you want something a bit more WYSIWYG for editing then could use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app) which provides a more user friendly interface for generating the Markdown code. Those of you who are [VS Code fans](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview) can edit/preview directly in that interface too.

## Category
⟹ The best enhancement to the Sitecore Admin (XP) for Content Editors & Marketers
## Description

⟹ Considering multi-lingual site sitecore Admin or Editors want to create content in different language or marketers are trying to create an email. Provided without inhouse translator the possible way is go to external sites to get the translated data. 
With this module Sitecore Admin or Editor need not go to external sites. Within Sitecore they can simply open the translator and translate the data to any languages.
This module used Azure Cognitive Services to translate the data. We are using Free version of the service which provides translation for 2 million words per month. If user requirement is exceeded the limit, we can always change the Pricing tier in Azure.
